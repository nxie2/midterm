# CSS 
## Z-patern
### I put the brand name on the top left corner of the site and linked that to the home page because that's what people look at first when they visit a site. The navigation bar on the top right corner because as people move their eyes across the page they are able to jump to subpages as they go. Descriptions of the series on the bottom left and the sign-up button on the bottom right because if people are interetsed and want to know more about the products and want to sign up for it they can do it easily. Or if they want to check on specific samples that are in the series they already know where the menu is ,so they can use the navigation menu to jump to the according subpage and read more about it.
## F-pattern
### I put a short description of the series on the top of the page so people know what they are about to read about as they go down. From left to right: I put the advanced buying option search bar because if people know what they want or they have any preferences, they can use the bar to locate the product they are looking for very easily. I then put the image because I want people to enjoy the look of the product first because if people like the look they are more likely to be interested to read more about it. And then I put the name of the product and its description of what it is and what it does. On the bottm of the descripton there is an add to cart button followed by a readmore button. If people are ready to check out they can do it right away, if they still want to read more about it before they check out they can click the read more button which will then take them to the readmore section on the bottom of the page. 
## C.R.A.P
### I used a light color background on all my subpages to show contrast between the black texts and the background.
### The add to cart and read more buttons show the principle of repetition.
### content is aligned well which demonstates the principle of alignment.
### Content that are related to each other such as the product name and its descripions are closer togther and contained in borders, which demonstates the principle of Proximiy.

## Fonts
### I chose the font Source+Sans+Pro for my headers because this font-face is fashionable and its neat looking which fits well with my site since its a cosmetic site. I chose the font Lato for my content because it is a neat font that is used for serious occasions such as election campaign billborads and information signs which makes it generally good at presenting information.

## CSS Structure
### I used SMACSS to organze my css. I catergorized all my css codes into parts like base,layout,modules,state, and theme styles.
